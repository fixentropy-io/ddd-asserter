# Known issues

## Setting up the project

In case you're running in an issue were `ddd-asserter` cannot resolve `@fixentropy-io/type` module, you would do the following:

**Start at the root of the project**

You'll need to clone `fixentropy-model` [repository](https://github.com/fixentropy-io/fixentropy-model)

```tree
fixentropy/ # Root of the project might be named differently
|-- ddd-asserter/
|-- fixentropy-model/
```


```bash
# Move into the `fixentropy-model` directory
cd fixentropy-model

# Create a link of the project
bun link

# Navigate to the `ddd-asserter` directory
cd ../ddd-asserter

# Link `fixentropy-model` to `ddd-asserter`
bun link @fixentropy-io/type
```

or by defining the dependency directly to the local folder:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
    "@fixentropy-io/type": "file:../fixentropy-model"
}
```
